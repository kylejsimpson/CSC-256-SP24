# About Me - Kyle Simpson

Hi, my name is **Kyle Simpson** and I've been a student here since the Summer of 2023. 

## Education
Before enrolling here, I attended *PCC* for three semesters. Unfortunately, I had to drop out which has left me a bit behind compared to many of my peers. 

## Current Goals
I am currently pursuing an **Associate's Degree in the Sciences**. I'm still undecided about continuing my education past that. I hope it will supplement my knowledge in:

- Creating 3D models
- Developing virtual environments using **Blender** and **Unreal Engine**

This education should also help in providing higher quality employment opportunities.

## Hobbies and Interests
My favorite activity at the moment is playing video games with my roommate on my **PS5**. It's not only a fun time that we both enjoy, but it also serves as inspiration for my future endeavors in game development.
